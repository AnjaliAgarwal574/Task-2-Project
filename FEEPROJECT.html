          <h2>About Career :</h2> </br>
          <p><h5>Mahendra Singh Dhoni was born on July 7th. 1981. He stayed with his family of four people, his father - Pan Singh, his mother - Devaki Dev, and his elder sister in the city of Ranchi, Jharkhand. 
            <br>He had a tough childhood not financially but because he has studied hard to fulfil his father’s dream. 
            But all of this has a side story where he practices with his school’s coach for bowl catching regularly. <br>He studied in a school named DAV Jawahar Vidya Mandir School located in Ranchi itself. 
            By a couple of months, he became an excellent goalkeeper in his football team. This skill turned him into an excellent wicket keeper in cricket. </p></h5><br>
            <br>
            
            
            <p><b></b>He was on the school’s football team and never played cricket. But his football coach sent him to a local cricket club considering his goal-keeping skills. 
            Soon he got selected in the U-19 squad member 1998-99. And after that when he reached 18, he played his first Ranji Trophy Bihar and played so well that he scored half a century. 
            He did a marvellous job in that game then soon people started recognizing his skills for cricket. <br> As time passed, due to his father’s pressure, he joined Indian Railways as a TTE (train ticket examiner). 
            But his passion still remained in cricket.</b> </p><br>
            
            
            Slowly, he managed to convince his father that he wanted to create his career in cricket and followed his dream. Now he is known for his captaincy all over the world and has huge respect.
